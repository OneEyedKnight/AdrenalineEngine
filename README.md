# What is Adrenaline Engine?

It was created due to my frustrations with working with Unity and Unreal (due to them using up so much memory). With the goal of being used to create a full fledge video game I sought to create my own engine
~~with blackjack and hookers~~. I have decided to release it to the public because this could benefit people some day.

# Goals for the engine
<li> Implement User Interface.  </li>
<li> Make it very user accessable. </li>
<li> Support for 2D. </li>
<li> Create a flexible framework that would easily allow other people to add in their own stuff to the engine. (Which could possible be merged into the original engine). </li>
<li> Lighting. </li>
<li> Audio. </li>
<li> Framework for game logic. </li>
<li> Possibly create a design suite. </li>
<li> Ultimately create a game using the engine. </li>
