# What is Adrenaline Engine?

It was created due to my frustrations working with Unity and Unreal due to them using up so much of my memory and storage space. Determined to one day create a full-fledged video game, I sought to create my own engine ~~with blackjack and hookers~~. 

I have released this engine to the public in hopes of having created something useful to other people.

NOTE: Currently it is in pre-beta meaning it is not suitable for public use yet (Unless you know what you're doing).

# Goals for the engine
<li> Implement User Interface.  </li>
<li> Make it very user accessable. </li>
<li> Support for 2D. </li>
<li> Create a flexible framework that would easily allow other people to add in their own stuff to the engine. (Which could possible be merged into the original engine). </li>
<li> Lighting. </li>
<li> Audio. </li>
<li> Framework for game logic. </li>
<li> Possibly create a design suite. </li>
<li> Make it cross platform (Currently tested on Mac and Windows) </li>
<li> Ultimately create a game using the engine. </li>
