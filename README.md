# What is Adrenaline Engine?

It was created due to my frustrations with working with Unity and Unreal (due to them using up so much memory). With the goal of creating a full fledge video game, I sought to create my own engine ~~with blackjack and hookers~~. I have decided to release it to the public because other people might find this useful as well.

NOTE: Currently it is in pre-beta meaning it is not suitable for public use yet (Unless you know what you're doing).

# Goals for the engine
<li> Implement User Interface.  </li>
<li> Make it very user accessable. </li>
<li> Support for 2D. </li>
<li> Create a flexible framework that would easily allow other people to add in their own stuff to the engine. (Which could possible be merged into the original engine). </li>
<li> Lighting. </li>
<li> Audio. </li>
<li> Framework for game logic. </li>
<li> Possibly create a design suite. </li>
<li> Make it cross platform (Currently writing and testing on a Mac) </li>
<li> Ultimately create a game using the engine. </li>

It is a placeholder company name coming from an inside joke.
